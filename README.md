#### Similarity of Human-Phenotype-Ontology (HPO) terms in patient groups.

This code estimates the probability of a group of individuals sharing their HPO
terms. This is useful when we have a set of probands all of whom have similar
genetic variation in a single gene (for example they all have de novo mutations
in the same gene). We have standardised phenotype terms, some of which may be
shared amongst the individuals. We want to know how likely the group is to share
those terms.

To estimate this probability, we need three things:
- a way to quantify similarity of HPO terms for a pair of probands.
- a way to quantify similarity across more than two probands.
- a null distribution of similarity scores for those probands

###### Proband pair HPO similarity
For a pair of probands, we have two lists of HPO terms. The code calculates a
matrix of information content scores, for each term in proband A versus each
term in proband B. The information content is from the most informative common
ancestor of the two terms. The IC scores are collapsed into a single score as
the maximum of the IC scores.

###### Proband group similarity
For a group of probands, I get a matrix of proband pair HPO similarity scores,
one score for each pairing. The scores are summed are across all the pairs to
get an overall similarity estimate for the group of probands.

###### Null distribution of similarity scores
A null distribution of similarity scores is simulated by randomly sampling
groups of probands. The similarity scores are calculated as above. The P value
is calculated as the proportion of simulated scores greater than the observed
probands' score.

Initially I thought we'd need to match the number of sampled HPO terms to the
numbers in the probands for the gene. For that, I sampled terms at the rate at
which they were observed in all the probands. However, the QQ plots from this
had an excess of extremely significant P values. I suspect this is due to
underlying relationships between HPO terms. Sampling probands seems better and
simpler.


##### Requirements
There are two python package requirements, both of which are pip installable:
- networkx
- matplotlib

This code incorporates the following code and datasets:
- a [python ontology parser](https://github.com/ntamas/gfam/blob/master/gfam/go/obo.py)
  written by Tam√°s Nepusz.
- the [obo file](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.obo) from the
  [Human Phenotype Ontology Consortium](http://human-phenotype-ontology.org/).

##### Running the code
The data directory includes two example input datafiles, one listing proband IDs
for each gene (data/example_genes.json), and the other listing HPO terms used
for each proband (data/example_phenotypes.json). Analysis results are by default
written to standard out. Run the code using the example datasets as:
```sh
python3 hpo similarity.py \
  --genes data/example_genes.json \
  --phenotypes data/example_phenotypes.json
```

This will not give any significant P-values, it merely demonstrates how to run
the code and proves that the code runs without errors. A real analysis requires
a large population of probands with HPO terms for reliable information content
scores, and to give a good population to sample from.

You can optionally use:
- `--output OUTPUT_PATH` to redirect the table of gene symbols and P values to a
  file.
- `--ontology ONTOLOGY_OBO_PATH` to specify a HPO ontology file other than the
  one included in the data directory.
- `--permute` to permute probands between genes, to assess whether the results
  match a null distribution in the absence of any true relationships.
